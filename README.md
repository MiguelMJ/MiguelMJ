## Hello there! I'm Miguel :octocat:

#### About me :eyeglasses:
I'm a Computer Science student. Programming is my passion and facing challenges excites me, so I'm always looking for something to work on.
I love learning as much as I love teaching, sharing knowledge is a high human value!

#### About my repos :computer:
**Graphic applications** ![C++][C++badge] & ![SFML][SFMLbadge]

- Velero-Engine is my own 2D game engine, my most ambitious project in this moment, currently under development.
- A Chess game made to learn about TCP communications and AI for games.
- Conway's Game of Life, just because it is a must.
- An interactive demo for 2D lighting, to practice a shadow casting algorithm.

#### Interests :book:
I work mainly on C++, sometimes with Bash, and I'm looking to work some more with Python, Java, R and web technologies.

My current fields of study are Machine Learning and Game Engine Theory.
